          <div class="card-text text-black-50">All my life, I have struggled with finding a career which fulfills me both mentally as well as financially. I don't like working from 9 to 5 every day, just to do a job I despise. Ever since I found YOUZR!, both my personal and professional life have changed dramatically. I now am a freelance photographer, with my own hours and complete freedom over what I want to work on. Thanks to YOUZR!, I am content with my life.</div>

          <div class="card-text text-black-50"> Since I was little, I have been kind of a follower and "obey the rules" kind of person. I was always afraid of what people might think of me if I'd speak up and let them hear my voice. One day, I decided I'd had enough of this mindless existence and decided to quit my job and search for a better future. That is when I found YOUZR!. For years, I was unhappy with my professional life, which made me very miserable in my personal life as well. However, YOUZR! has shown me that with careful selection and countless of professionals helping me, I could find my dream job and that I could even travel the world while working! YOUZR! is definitely for ME, I'm sure it will also be the best option for YOU!</div>

          <div class="card-text text-black-50">I've always been a hard worker. Working from 9 to 5 wasn't ever a big issue for me. However, I just always felt like I was doing work that didn't resonate with me. After having worked in construction for 12 years, I decided to quit and follow my passion: music. For the last 6 months, I have been playing in small theaters and music halls all over the world with an amazing band. I make enough money to be able to afford doing this indefinitely, and I have no intentions of stopping soon. Thank you, thank YOUZR!.</div>

          <div class="card-text text-black-50">In life, there are only a couple of things that matter: love, happiness and financial stability. Unfortunately, I was not doing great with any of these three before I started using YOUZR!. I was unemployed, I didn't have a lot of friends and I'd never had a boyfriend. However, now I'm a freelance model working for companies all over the world who pay me to fly over to them and do photoshoots. I have friends all over the world and my boyfriend and I just got engaged. Trust me, YOUZR! is for YOU! </div>
